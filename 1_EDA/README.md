A SQL project analyzing the data engineer job market using real world job posting data. It demonstrates my ability to **write production-quality analytical SQL, design efficient queries, and turn business questions into data-driven insights**.

## 🧾 Executive summary

- ✅ **Project scope**: Built **3 analytical queries** that answer key questions about the data engineer job market
- ✅ **Data modeling**: Used **multi-table joins** across fact and dimension tables to extract insights
- ✅ **Analytics**: Applied **aggregations, filtering, and sorting** to find top skills by demand, salary, and overall value
- ✅ **Outcomes**: Delivered **actionable insights** on SQL/Python dominance, cloud trends, and salary patterns

If you only have a minute, review these:

1. [`01_top_demanded_skills.sql`](./01_top_demanded_skills.sql) – demand analysis with multi-table joins
2. [`02_top_paying_skills.sql`](./02_top_paying_skills.sql) – salary analysis with aggregations
3. [`03_optimal_skills.sql`](./03_optimal_skills.sql) – combined demand/salary optimization query

## 🧩 Problem & Context

Job market analysts need to answer questions like:

- 🎯 **Most in-demand**: Which skills are most in-demand for data engineers?
- 💰 **Highest paid**: Which skills command the highest salaries?
- ⚖️ **Best trade-off**: What is the optimal skill set balancing demand and compensation?

This project analyzes a data warehouse built using a star schema design. The warehouse structure consists of:

![Data Warehouse](../Images/1_2_Data_Warehouse.png)

- **Fact Table**: `job_postings_fact` - Central table containing job posting details (job titles, locations, salaries, dates, etc.)
- **Dimension Tables**:
    - `company_dim` - Company information linked to job postings
    - `skills_dim` - Skills catalog with skill names and types
- **Bridge Table**: `skills_job_dim` - Resolves the many-to-many relationship between job postings and skills

By querying across these interconnected tables, I extracted insights about skill demand, salary patterns, and optimal skill combinations for data engineering roles.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐤 **Query Engine**: DuckDB for fast OLAP-style analytical queries
- 🧮 **Language**: SQL (ANSI-style with analytical functions)
- 📊 **Data Model**: Star schema with fact + dimension + bridge tables
- 🛠️ **Development**: VS Code for SQL editing + Terminal for DuckDB CLI
- 📦 **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for versioned SQL scripts

## 🏗️ Analysis Overview

### Query Structure
1. **[Top Demanded Skills](./01_top_demanded_skills.sql)** – Identifies the 10 most in-demand skills for remote data engineer positions
2. **[Top Paying Skills](./02_top_paying_skills.sql)** – Analyzes the 25 highest-paying skills with salary and demand metrics
3. **[Optimal Skills](./03_optimal_skills.sql)** – Calculates an optimal score using natural log of demand combined with median salary to identify the most valuable skills to learn

### Key Insights
- 🧠 Core languages: SQL and Python each appear in ~29,000 job postings, making them the most demanded skills
- ☁️ Cloud platforms: AWS and Azure are critical for modern data engineering roles-
- 🧱 Infra & tooling: Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform are associated with premium salaries
- 🔥 Big data tools: Apache Spark shows strong demand with competitive compensation


## 💻 SQL Skills Demonstrated

### Query Design & Optimization

- **Complex Joins**: Multi-table `INNER JOIN` operations across `job_postings_fact`, `skills_job_dim`, and `skills_dim`
- **Aggregations**: `COUNT()`, `MEDIAN()`, `ROUND()` for statistical analysis
- **Filtering**: Boolean logic with `WHERE` clauses and multiple conditions (`job_title_short`, `job_work_from_home`, `salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`)
- **Sorting & Limiting**: `ORDER BY` with `DESC` and `LIMIT` for top-N analysis

### Data Analysis Techniques

- **Grouping**: `GROUP BY` for categorical analysis by skill Mathematical 
- **Functions**: `LN()` for natural logarithm transformation to normalize demand metrics
- **Calculated Metrics**: Derived optimal score combining log-transformed demand with median salary
- **HAVING Clause**: Filtering aggregated results (skills with >= 100 postings)
- **NULL Handling**: Proper filtering of incomplete records (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`)
